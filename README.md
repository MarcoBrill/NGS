# NGS Analysis Pipeline with AI

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data using modern AI techniques. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, deep learning model training, and evaluation.

## Inputs
1. **FASTA File**: Input NGS data in FASTA format (e.g., `sample.fasta`).
2. **Labels**: Placeholder labels for binary classification (modify as needed).

## Outputs
1. **Model Accuracy**: Prints the test accuracy of the trained model.
2. **Trained Model**: Saves the trained model (optional).

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## How to Run the Script
Save the Python script as ngs_pipeline.py.

Create a data/ directory and place your FASTA file (e.g., sample.fasta) inside it.

Install the required libraries:
bash    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script:
bash    python ngs_pipeline.py

## Notes
Modify the script to suit your specific NGS analysis task (e.g., variant calling, gene expression analysis).
Replace placeholder labels (y) with actual labels for your dataset.
For large datasets, consider using distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark or Dask.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ngs-pipeline.git
   cd ngs-pipeline
