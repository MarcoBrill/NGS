# NGS Analysis Pipeline with AI

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data using modern AI techniques. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, deep learning model training, and evaluation.

## Inputs
1. **FASTA File**: Input NGS data in FASTA format (e.g., `sample.fasta`).
2. **Labels**: Placeholder labels for binary classification (modify as needed).

## Outputs
1. **Model Accuracy**: Prints the test accuracy of the trained model.
2. **Trained Model**: Saves the trained model (optional).

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ngs-pipeline.git
   cd ngs-pipeline
